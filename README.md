# LOCAL-AIR-QUALITY-MONITORING-SYSTEM
This project aims to develop a Python application that fetches real-time air quality data for a user-specified location and provides clear health-based alerts based on Air Quality Index (AQI) levels. The system helps individuals stay informed about the pollution levels in their locality and take necessary precautions to protect their health.
